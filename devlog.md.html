**Lidar Dynamic Detection**
    Rahul Kandekar

Starting point for this repo
============================

I've already been experimenting with this idea in another repo for a while now. 
Here are the highlights

- Implemented the problem of finding the $\Delta(\theta, x, y)$ between 
    consecutive scans as a gradient descent problem in tensorflow
- Demonstrated effectiveness using a simulation of lidar scans.
- Its really slow on my machine
- Exploring a few different optimization strategies. 

**************************************************
*      Scan1 -> Lidar moves        ->    Scan2
*        |      in environment             |  
*        v                                 |
*     Scan1 transformed                    |
*     to match motion                      |
*        |                                 |
*        |                                 |
*         '-->  Difference between     <--' 
*               Scans is recognized 
*               motion
